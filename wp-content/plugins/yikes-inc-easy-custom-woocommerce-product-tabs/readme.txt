This plugin extends WooCommerce to allow site admins to add custom tabs to products. 

== Description ==

This plugin extends the [WooCommerce](www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/) eCommerce plugin to allow site admins to add custom tabs to products.

Tabs are managed on the Edit Product screen and can be added on a per product basis. Tabs can be easily added, deleted and rearranged.

Tab content areas use the standard WYSIWYG WordPress editor, and may contain text, html or shortcodes. 

If you experience any problems, please submit a New Issue on our [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/yikesinc/yikes-inc-easy-custom-woocommerce-product-tabs/issues) and we'll look in to it as soon as possible.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I go to add tabs to a product? =
When editing a product in WoCommerce, you will find "Custom Tabs" in the bottom left corner of the Product Data box. Click on "Custom Tabs" to reveal the custom tab manager.

= Where will these tabs appear? =
When the product is viewed on your website you will see the tabs you created to the right of the default "Description" tab. 

= I added tabs, but they didn't appear on the front-end of the site. What's up? =
Make sure you hit the Product's main Update button to save all the edits you made to custom tabs or they will not be saved.

= How do I change the order of the tabs? =
To change the order of the custom tabs use the up and down arrows to the right of the Tab Title.

= Does the custom tab data get exported with the standard WooCommerce product data? =
Yes! Since v1.4 we've added the necessary hooks and filters to ensure the custom tab data is exported with all of the other standard WooCommerce data. This ensures a smooth transition of products between sites.
